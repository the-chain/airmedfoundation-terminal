# Airmed Foundation - Node.js Terminal 

The [Airmed Foundation](https://airmedfoundation.thechain.tech/) is an open source initiative that provides a secure channel to store and transfer medical records. It is based on the [Interplanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) and [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/). The conjunction of these technologies guarantees the immutability and availability of the data.

In order to achieve secure and reliable file management:

* We replicate all records on the IPFS network using the Bittorrent protocol. 
* We restrict access to records using asymmetric cryptography. 
* We protect and store cryptographic access keys in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.

Sharing files with the Airmed Foundation platform is pretty straightforward. Depending on their desired privacy level, one can upload files with or without asymmetric encryption. We have created [this tutorial](https://airmedfoundation.thechain.tech/tutorial) to explain both procedures.

## Installation and Usage

The following dependencies must be downloaded and installed in order to use Airmed Foundation's Node.js terminal:
* Interplanetary File System (IPFS)
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Node.js
* NPM
* NVM
* Hyperledger Fabric

Here we guide you through this process.

**Interplanetary File System (IPFS)**

Project website: https://ipfs.io/

```
wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.4.19/go-ipfs_v0.4.19_linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz go-ipfs_v0.4.19_linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd go-ipfs
sudo ./install.sh
ipfs init
```

**Docker and Docker Compose**

Project website: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/ (Docker)\
Project website: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ (Docker Compose)

```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo apt-get install docker-compose
```

**Node.js, NPM and NVM**

Project website: https://nodejs.org/en/ (Node.js)\
Project website: https://www.npmjs.com/ (NPM)\
Project repo: https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation-and-update (NVM)

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
nvm install 8.15.0
nvm use 8.15.0
```

**Hyperledger Fabric**

Project website: https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric

```
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples
cd fabric-samples
./scripts/bootstrap.sh 1.4.0 1.4.0
cd first-network
./byfn.sh generate
./byfn.sh up
```

**Download Airmed Foundation**

Project website: https://airmedfoundation.thechain.tech/

```
git clone https://github.com/the-chain/airmedfoundation-terminal
cd airmedfoundation-terminal
npm install 
```

**Install Chaincode to Hyperledger Network**

```
cd airmedfoundation-terminal
docker exec -it cli peer chaincode instantiate -C mychannel -l "node" -n airmed -v v1 -c '{"Args":[]}' -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem
docker exec -it cli peer chaincode instantiate -C mychannel -l "node" -n secureRec -v v1 -c '{"Args":[]}' -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem
```

## Configuration of Airmed Foundation's server

**Edit config/datastores.js**

Change values to connect to postgreSQL. In order to install postgreSQL, you can run the following command in the terminal:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

**Setup appconfig.json**
```
{ "email": { "admin":"admin_email@gmail.com", "auth": { "user": "admin_email@gmail.com", "pass": "password" }, "service": "Gmail", "emailVerification": 1 }, "database": { "adapter": "sails-postgresql", "user": "admin", "password": "adminpassword", "port": "5432", "host": "localhost", "database": "airmed" }, "session": { "name": "sails.sid", "secret": "secretKey", "redis": { "url": "redis://: redisPassword@127.0.0.1.com:6379/15", "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 6379, "pass": "redisPassword", "db": 15 } }, "ipfs": { "host":"127.0.0.1", "port":"5001" } }
```

**Edit config/policies.js**

For testing purposes, remove comment from line 20. 
That is, line 
```
//'*': 'isHTTPS',
```
should now look like
```
'*': 'isHTTPS',
```

**Edit Hyperledger configuration file**

In the file fabric-api/config/configfile.yaml, you should replace the default admin certificate paths with the actual path of your project. Please note that you should only modify paths from adminPrivateKey in Line 44 under Org1, and in Line 56 under Org2. Everything else must remain unaltered.

As a further advice, please make sure that fabric-sample and airmedfoundation-terminal are in the same directory. 

The paths should look as follows:\
/home/root/Desktop/fabric-sample\
/home/root/Desktop/airmedfoundation-terminal

## Running the application
Running the application is very simple. You just need to:

- Run IPFS
```
ipfs daemon &
```

- Run the server
```
node ./node_modules/sails/bin/sails.js l --redis --safe
```

- Run the sync process
```
./init.sh &
```

And now you're ready to go!
